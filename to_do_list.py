# Sure! How about building a **To-Do List app** in Python? Itâ€™s a great way to practice working with data structures, file handling, and basic user interfaces.

# ### Task: Create a To-Do List Application

# **Features:**
# 1. **Add a Task**: Allow the user to add tasks.
# 2. **View Tasks**: Show all tasks that have been added.
# 3. **Mark Tasks as Done**: Allow the user to mark tasks as completed.
# 4. **Delete a Task**: Let the user delete a task if itâ€™s no longer needed.
# 5. **Save and Load Tasks**: Save the tasks to a file so they persist between sessions.

# **Bonus:**
# - Implement a simple text-based user interface.
# - Sort the tasks based on whether they are completed or not.

# ### Suggested Python Concepts to Practice:
# - Lists (to hold the tasks)
# - File handling (to save and load tasks)
# - Basic functions (for each of the operations)
# - Conditionals (to check if a task is done)
# - Loops (to display tasks and interact with the user)
